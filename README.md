# Basemath

(Description of who/what the library is for, the benefits it presents, a brief description of how it accomplishes providing those benefits, linking to the paper in case there's interest in more detail beyond that)

## Installation
Simply install the library using your package manger of choice.

For instance, with pip:

```pip install basemath-analysis```

## Usage
Demonstrating the usage through an example scenario that references more concrete concepts like RpV, e.g. "Let's suppose we're running an experiment, we choose X for our alpha, Y for beta, etc." and then this being reflected in the example below.

In this example scenario, we can broadly cover:
- What variables need to be provided for initialization
- Consideration for binary vs nonbinary metric
- What helpful information is available after initialization (e.g. number of required samples) and what we might want to do with it

```python
basemath = BaseMathsTest(..., X, Y)
```

We continue with the example scenario here, "We've been running our experiment for however long and collected N samples...", how that translates into the parameters and potential return values

```python
basemath.evaluate_experiment(...)
```
